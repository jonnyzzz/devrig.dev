# React Examples

This page demonstrates React components integrated into the Hugo static site.

## Platform Detector

This component detects your current operating system and architecture:

<div id="platform-detector"></div>

## Interactive Download Buttons

Download the latest devrig release for your platform:

<div id="download-buttons"></div>

## How It Works

These interactive components are built with:
- **React** for component-based UI
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Webpack** for bundling
- **Hugo** for static site generation

The React components are mounted to specific DOM elements in the markdown content, allowing seamless integration between static Hugo pages and dynamic React functionality.

## How It Works

These interactive components are built with:
- **React** for component-based UI
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Webpack** for bundling
- **Hugo** for static site generation

The React components are mounted to specific DOM elements in the markdown content, allowing seamless integration between static Hugo pages and dynamic React functionality.

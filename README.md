# IDE Wrapper

A command-line tool that helps download, install, manage, and configure IDE and development environments for your project. 
Inspired by the simplicity of Gradle and Maven Wrappers, this tool enables a straightforward setup for both new and experienced
contributors—simply include the binary and a config file in your repository, and you’re good to go!
